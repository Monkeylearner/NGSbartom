# NGSbartom
buildPipelineScripts.pl is an NGS pipeline put together in collaboration between the Bartom Lab, the Shilatifard lab, the Ntziachristos Lab, the Pulmonology Division, and other scientists at Northwestern University.

It supports RNA and ChIP seq analysis, and will be expanded to support variant calling in the future.
